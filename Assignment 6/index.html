            <h3>ODI</h3>
            <p>
              Kohli is regarded as the best limited-overs batsman in the world,
              especially while chasing. In ODIs, he averages around 69 in
              matches batting second as opposed to around 51 batting first. 26
              of his 43 ODI hundreds have come in run-chases and he holds the
              record for most hundreds batting second. Kohli is often compared
              to Sachin Tendulkar, due to their similar styles of batting, and
              sometimes referred to as Tendulkar's "successor". Many former
              cricketers expect Kohli to break Tendulkar's batting records. He
              is ranked as one of the world's most famous athletes by ESPN Kohli
              has stated that growing up his idol and role model was Tendulkar
              and that as a kid he "tried to copy the shots [Tendulkar] played
              and hit sixes the way he used to hit them."Former West Indies
              great Vivian Richards, who is regarded as the most destructive
              batsman in cricket, stated that Kohli reminds him of himself.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              In early 2015, Richards said Kohli was "already legendary" in the
              ODI format, while former Australian cricketer Dean Jones called
              Kohli the "new king of world cricket"

            <h3>Test</h3>
            <p>
              Kohli started his test debut in 2011 against West Indies. He
              proved his credentials as a Test batsman on the tour of South
              Africa when he scored a sensational first innings hundred in
              Johannesburg in the first Test to bail India out of trouble and
              backed it up with a 96 in the second innings. However, against the
              raised seam of the Dukes ball and the skillful bowling of England,
              Kohli's technical shortcomings were exposed when India toured
              England in 2014 for a grueling 5-Test series. He scored just 134
              runs in ten innings, edging the ball to the slips by reaching out
              for it, and showing poor awareness of his off-stump
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Kohli, now the full-time Test captain, toured Sri Lanka with a
              young side without the services of Mahendra Singh Dhoni, wary of
              the Sri Lankan spinners' fabled 4th innings con-job. After losing
              the first Test, Kohli's India recorded a dramatic come-from-behind
              win in the series, going on to win 2-1. Kohli continued to build
              on his auspicious start to Test captaincy as he led them to a rout
              of the South Africans on a series of rank-turners all around
              India. Nonetheless, the triumph took India to the No. 1 spot in
              the ICC Test rankings

            <h3>IPL</h3>
            <p>
              Following the Under-19 World Cup, Kohli was bought by the Indian
              Premier League franchise Royal Challengers Bangalore for $30,000
              on a youth contract. He was the captain of Royal challengers
              Bangalore for 8 seasons but could not win a trophy.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              At the 2016 IPL, the Royal Challengers finished runners-up and
              Kohli broke the record for most runs in an IPL season (of 733
              runs) by scoring 973 runs in 16 matches at an average of 81.08,
              winning the Orange Cap as well as Most-valuable Player Award of
              Vivo IPL 2016. He scored four centuries in the tournament, having
              never scored one in the Twenty20 format before the start of the
              season, and also became the first player to reach the 4000-run
              milestone in the IPL.
